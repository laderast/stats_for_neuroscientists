<h2>Post-Class</h2>
<p>Please fill out the following survey and we will discuss the results during the next lecture. All responses will be anonymous.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearest Point: What was the most clear part of the lecture?</li>
<li>Muddiest Point: What was the most unclear part of the lecture to you?</li>
<li>Anything Else: Is there something you’d like me to know?</li>

<p>how Otsu’s filter actually works. And examples of filter shapes at the end making different images would have helped clarify that - it didn’t make a ton of intuitive sense how that would work</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s a page that describes exactly how Otsu’s method is calculated:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.labbookpages.co.uk/software/imgProc/otsuThreshold.html" class="uri">http://www.labbookpages.co.uk/software/imgProc/otsuThreshold.html</a></p>
<p>We will cover filter shapes in lab.</p>

<p>still a little bit unclear on when neighborhoods overlap vs are non-overlapping. The way I’m thinking about it is that a neighborhood by definition is non-overlapping in normal thresholding, but adaptive thresholding uses overlapping neighborhoods? I think i’m going in circles and confusing myself more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Normal thresholding doesn’t use neighborhoods at all - it’s an absolute threshold that is applied to all of the pixels.</p>
<p>Here’s another explanation for <em>adaptive</em> thresholding that hopefully will fill in the gaps: <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/adpthrsh.htm" class="uri">http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/adpthrsh.htm</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The math behind Otsu’s and Dilation and Erosion</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On the idea of adaptive threshold: is each pixel in the image going to have a different threshold? For example on slide 14 of the lecture slides, the 4, highlighted in green, in the teal box will have a different threshold than the 4 to the left because that pixel will have different neighboring pixel values.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m still a little confused about the calculations behind erosion and dilation. (e.g. examples shown in slide 18 and 20)</p>
