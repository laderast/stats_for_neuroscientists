<h2>Post-Class</h2>
<p>Please fill out the following survey and we will discuss the results during the next lecture. All responses will be anonymous.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearest Point: What was the most clear part of the lecture?</li>
<li>Muddiest Point: What was the most unclear part of the lecture to you?</li>
<li>Anything Else: Is there something you’d like me to know?</li>

<h2>Muddiest Points</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I was a little bit confused about the watershed algorithm. When you are setting the boundaries around objects, are you able to set up variable boundaries? (ie. set up a border between object x and y, which is different from the border between x and z)? - to achieve better separation for example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The boundaries are determined by when each valley is flooded by another valley - you basically define the boundary right before the flooding (building a dam).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do these segementations only work you start from a binarized image? and when is it better to use distance transformation versus the watershed algorithm?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok. watershed only works on distance mapping, as it has to traverse a continuous surface, not a discontinuous surface like the binarized image.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the 3D representation of the nearest neighbor map. I liked the explanation of watershed algorithms, but I was initially confused what the 3D representation was – this got cleared up in the end though so I think it makes sense now</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As far as the watershed segmenting, I’m still a little muddy on the 3D representation</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m still working on understanding the watershed algorithm and how it is extrapolating a 2D image into 3D.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the plot of the distance matrix didn’t make as much sense - wouldn’t there be a gradient on the exterior of the image also?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. I understand this was confusing. Hopefully the lab will clarify this. The <code>distmap()</code> function is what is creating the 3D surface.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you do the watershed segmentation to separate the boundaries and then apply a filter to round out the boundaries and get a better estimate of the area/size?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the output of the watershed is a labeled image, it doesn’t make sense to filter after the segmentation, as you will lose the labels for each of the objects.</p>
