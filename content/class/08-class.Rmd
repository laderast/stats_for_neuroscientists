## Discussion

We will be discussing the following article:

- Fluoresecence Microscopy: Avoiding the Pitfalls. https://jcs.biologists.org/content/joces/120/10/1703.full.pdf

Pick two of the pitfalls. 

For each pitfall that you picked, be prepared to discuss the following.

1. In your opinion, is this pitfall an issue when acquiring microscopy images?

2. If you have had any experience with this pitfall, what did you do to overcome it?

3. (Optional): Do you have any images that show this pitfall? Share them with the class

## Post-Class

Please fill out the following survey and we will discuss the results during the next lecture. All responses will be anonymous.

- Clearest Point: What was the most clear part of the lecture?
- Muddiest Point: What was the most unclear part of the lecture to you?
- Anything Else: Is there something you'd like me to know?
