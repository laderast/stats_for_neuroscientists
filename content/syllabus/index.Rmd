## Course Description

This course is a gentle introduction to statistical concepts that are relevant to image processing. We will cover steps of the image processing workflow on cellular images, culminating in simple spatial
analysis on cellular structures in the image. No previous background in statistics is required. The focus of this course is not on programming, but on assessing image processing workflows and understanding their impact on downstream analysis. To do this, we will take a lab notebook approach to image processing, comparing the effect of different methods on each step of the image processing workflow.

## Credit Hours

2 credit hours. 

## Learning Objectives

1.  **Learn** and **execute** the basic steps of image analysis in R.
2.  **Assess** whether image processing algorithms are working correctly.
3.  **Understand** basic spatial statistics and how to **assess** null models of spatial data.
4.  **Execute** and **Interpret** basic spatial statistics on data that are involved with fluoresence microscopy analysis.

## Course Website

All course information will be available here:

## Code of Conduct

This class is governed by the BioData Club Code of Conduct:
<https://biodata-club.github.io/code_of_conduct/>

This class is meant to be a psychologically safe space where it's ok to ask questions. I want to normalize your own curiosity and fuel your desire to learn more.

If you are disruptive to class learning or disparaging to other students, I may mute you for the day. I am very serious about this.

## Required Texts or Readings

We will be drawing on the following online textbooks during class and labs.

*Analyzing fluorescence microscopy images with ImageJ*. Pete Bankhead.
<https://petebankhead.gitbooks.io/imagej-intro/content/>

*Modern Statistics for Modern Biologists*. Susan Holmes and Wolfgang
Huber. <http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/>

*Getting Used to R, RStudio, and RMarkdown*. Chester Ismay.

## Words of Encouragement

> This was adopted from Andrew Heiss. Thanks!

I *promise* you can succeed in this class.

Learning R can be difficult at first—it's like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you'll be using like `ggplot2`—[made this wise observation](https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/): 

> It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.

Even experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors. If you're finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, e-mail me, etc.

## Attendance Requirements

Online attendance is required. Please let me know if you have to miss class. If you miss a lab day, know that you are responsible for finishing the lab and understanding the content.

Classes will be recorded, but please do not use this as an excuse to miss class.

## Grading Policy

Grades will be based on the following:

- In class discussion 15%
- Midterm 20%
- Homework (from labs) 45%
- Final Project 20%

This course will be graded on a Pass/Fail Basis. Pass is defined as a grade of at least 70%.

### Late Policy

Students get 1 free assignment to submit late without penalties. Please email us through Sakai that you need more time. If you need accomodation, please email us so we can figure out a way to help you.

Graduate Studies in the OHSU School of Medicine is committed to providing grades to students in a timely manner. Course instructors will provide students with information in writing at the beginning of each
course that describes the grading policies and procedures including but not limited to evaluation criteria, expected time needed to grade individual student examinations and type of feedback they will provide.

Class grades are due to the Registrar by the Friday following the week of finals. However, on those occasions when a grade has not been submitted by the deadline, the following procedure shall be followed:

1)  The Department/Program Coordinator will immediately contact the Instructor requesting the missing grade, with a copy to the Program Director and Registrar.

2)  If the grade is still overdue by the end of next week, the Department/Program Coordinator will email the Department Chair directly, with a copy to the Instructor and Program Director requesting resolution of the missing grade.

3)  If, after an additional week the grade is still outstanding, the student or Department/Program Coordinator may petition the Office of Graduate students for final resolution.

1.  *For courses that are run by a specific department.*

2.  *For the conjoined courses (course number is preceded by CON\_ that
    are run by Graduate Studies.*
