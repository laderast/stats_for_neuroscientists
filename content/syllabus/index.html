<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>This course is a gentle introduction to statistical concepts that are relevant to image processing. We will cover steps of the image processing workflow on cellular images, culminating in simple spatial
analysis on cellular structures in the image. No previous background in statistics is required. The focus of this course is not on programming, but on assessing image processing workflows and understanding their impact on downstream analysis. To do this, we will take a lab notebook approach to image processing, comparing the effect of different methods on each step of the image processing workflow.</p>

<h2>Words of Encouragement</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This was adopted from Andrew Heiss. Thanks!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <em>promise</em> you can succeed in this class.</p>
<p>Learning R can be difficult at first—it’s like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like <code>ggplot2</code>—<a href="https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/">made this wise observation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors. If you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, e-mail me, etc.</p>
