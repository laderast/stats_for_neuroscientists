<h2>COURSE DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>This course is a gentle introduction to statistical concepts that are relevant to image processing. We will cover steps of the image processing workflow on cellular images, culminating in simple spatial
analysis on cellular structures in the image. No previous background in statistics is required. The focus of this course is not on programming, but on assessing image processing workflows and understanding their impact on downstream analysis. To do this, we will take a lab notebook approach to image processing, comparing the effect of different methods on each step of the image processing workflow.</p>
