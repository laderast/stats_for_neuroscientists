# Learning Objectives

- Understand the steps of hypothesis testing
- Understand that hypothesis testing specifies a null hypothesis
- Understand the importance of the *null hypothesis* in generating the null distribution
- Apply *shuffling* to permute the null distribution
- Interpret the p-value under permutations

# How Special is our Data?

How special is our data compared to fake data generated under the *null hypothesis*?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=10}
samps <- lapply(1:100, function(x){samp <- sample(1:nrow(features2), nrow(features2))
return(samp)})

out_permute <- lapply(1:12, function(x){
  perm <- samps[[x]]
  new_features <- features2
  new_features$type <- new_features$type[perm]
  new_features$run <- x
  return(new_features)
})

out_permute[[7]] <- data.frame(run=7, features2)

test <- dplyr::bind_rows(out_permute)

ggplot(test) + aes(x=type, y=x_0_s_area, fill=type) + geom_boxplot() +

# Why Hypothesis Test?

- Given our observed sample, assess whether we can make an inference about the real value given:
    - Limited sample size
    - Small Effect size
- What kind of inference? Are we comfortable with our results compared to randomly generated data?

---
# Hypothesis Test

- Test between a *null* and *alternative* hypothesis
- Alternative hypothesis (Ha) - What we're interested in
- Null Hypothesis (Ho) - what we expect from just chance and noise

---
# Steps in Hypothesis Testing

1. Define Test Statistic
2. Specify alternative hypothesis with test statistic
3. Use alternative hypothesis to specify null hypothesis
4. Decide on a significance level
5. Calculate observed test statstic
6. Permute Data and generate distribution
7. Calculate p-value
8. Interpret!

# Our Test Statistic

- Difference between means of the two groups
  - `bc` and `nuc`

# Empirical versus Theoretical 

- Theoretical distributions rely on assumptions
  - Normality is a big one!
- Empirical distributions utilize data
