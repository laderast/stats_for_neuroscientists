## Textbooks

We will be using three main books for our course. They are all available for free online. Reading assignments will be given at the end of the slides. Students are responsible for having read the reading before the lab.

- [Analyzing fluoresence microscopy images with ImageJ](https://petebankhead.gitbooks.io/imagej-intro/content/) by Pete Bankhead
- [R Basics](https://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book/) by Chester Ismay and Patrick C. Kennedy
- [Modern Dive](http://moderndive.com/) by Chester Ismay and Albert Kim

## Midterm

The midterm exam will cover the first five weeks of the course and will be a take home exam, due 1 week after it is assigned.
