# Learning Objectives

- **Learn** and **apply** *segmentation* algorithms to detect objects in an image
- **Understand** and **correct** for issues that may affect segmentation of an image
- **Use** a distance transform to find the centers of a detected object

---
# Starting point: Binarized image


---
# Finding the center of an object: Distance Transform

- Very special transform that calcluates
