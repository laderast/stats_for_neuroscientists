Let's talk about RStudio Cloud paths

# RStudio Cloud

<img src= "image/week1/rstudio.jpg" width = 800>

???

- Web based version of RStudio
- All software is installed for you

---

<img src="image/week1/project1.jpg" width=800>

???

- Projects have a root (where the `.rproj` file lives)
- Projects have a `data/` folder
- RMarkdown notebooks live in the root folder (`.Rmd` files)
- Rendered RMarkdown notebooks are `.nb.html` files

---
<img src="image/week1/project2.jpg" width = 800>

???
- Images should be in the `data/` folder (`.tif` files)
- if we want to use an image called `image.tif` that is in the ``data` folder, we refer to it by `data/image.tif` in our notebook.

---
<img src="image/week1/project3.jpg" width = 800>

???

- Optionally, we can have a `docs` folder
- We'll put slides and cheat sheets here

---
# Thursday's Lab

- Learning R/RStudio
- Loading images
- Making histograms

---
class: center, middle
## Let's talk about image acquisition

---
![](image/week1/intro_exciting.png)

???

- Depending on the amount of observed fluoresence, our detector (our camera) can quantify it as a number.

---
# Detecting Things

- Our overall focus in this course is in **detecting** cells and cellular proteins and their location in an image.
- What are some cellular structures we'd like to detect? (Type them in chat)

---
# What are Images?

 ![Image Data](image/week1/raster_concept.png)

.footnote[https://petebankhead.gitbooks.io/imagej-intro/content/chapters/images_and_pixels/images_and_pixels.html]

???
- Images are represented as a **matrix** (also known as an array) of numbers
- Horizontal Lines of an image correspond to *rows* in the table
- Vertical Lines of an image correspond to *columns* of the table

---
# Arrays

Images are an example of what is called a *matrix* or a 2 dimensional *array*.

An array has *columns*, and *rows*

---
# Columns and Rows

This is a 200 x 200 pixel image

<img src="image/week1/kid_example.png" width=200>

200    x   200  
*Columns* x *Rows*  

*200 x 200 pixels* is also called the **resolution** of the image.

---
# Where is [1, 1]?

.pull-left[
Top left corner of the image is always referred to as [1,1]
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
image <- EBImage::readImage("image/week1/kid_example.tif")
plot(image)
```
]

---
# Subsetting an Image

.pull-left[
<img src = "image/week1/kid_example.png" width = 400>
]

.pull-right[

<img src = "image/week1/small_image.png" width = 200>
]

???

If we wanted to get the bottom left quadrant of the photo, we want a subimage of 100 x 100 pixels. 

Well, we can use technique called *subsetting* to get this quadrant.

We want the first 100 columns and the last 100 rows of our image. How do we refer to this?

---

<img src="image/week1/image_array1.jpg" width=800>

???

- If our loaded image is called `image`, we use the bracket (`[,]`) notation to refer to *rows* and *columns* in it. The notation is [column, row]

- One thing to note. This is a computer graphics standard and it's opposite to how other data structures in R work. They are usually [row, column]

---

<img src="image/week1/image_array2.jpg" width=800>

???

- The `51:100` and `1:50` are called **sequences**. They are a short hand for *every number between* 51 and 100 (including 51 and 100).

---
# Your Turn

Question: What does the sequence `1:50` refer to in the statement 

```
image[1:50,51:100]
```

? Is this sequence referring to the rows or columns?

Place answer in chat.

---

<img src="image/week1/image_array3.jpg" width=800>

???

- In the lower left of the diagram, you'll see where each part of the sequence aligns to.
- Our subset is the bottom left.

---
# Your Turn

If we have a 200 x 200 pixel image, how do we refer to the top right quadrant? (use the format `image[a:b, x:y]`)

Place answer in chat

---
# Intensity

The numeric value at a particular pixel represents the intensity of light at that particular image.

These numeric values can either be:

- A unsigned Integer (0-127)
  - Usually used when images are acquired by an instrument
- Decimal values (also known as `double`) (0.156, 0.630, etc)   
  - ranges from 0 to 1
  - This is usually what we'll use

---
# Transformed images

- Usually have decimal values (0.1, 0.33, 0.555), etc
- Usually range from 0 to 1
- File size can be larger than integer-valued images

---
<img src="image/week1/histogram2.jpg" width=800>

???

One of our most useful tools for understanding an image is the **intensity histogram**.

Our x-axis is our intensity value, and our y-axis are the number of pixels in our image that have that particular intensity value.

--- 
<img src="image/week1/histogram2.jpg" width=800>

???

Each box represents the number of pixels in that intensity range

---
# What can you tell from this histogram?

```{r echo=FALSE}
hist(image)
```

---
# Your Turn

.pull-left[
- Are the pixel values *floating point* or *integer*?
- What is the maximum observed value in the image?
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
hist(image)
```
]
---

<img src="image/week1/overexposure.JPG" width = 800>

---
# Color images 

Color images are usually represented by three different intensity values, that are stored in separate *layers* within the file: 

- one for Red 
- one for Blue
- one for Green

---
# Multi-Channel images

<img src="image/week1/multi-channel.jpg">

???

- Sometimes you use a different stain/antibody to label different proteins. Then the different intensity values correspond to **channels**.
- We often do this when we're interested in quantifying whether two proteins are *co-located*. 
- To do this, we will need to process each channel separately, and then combine the results in the end.

---
# Accessing layers

If an image has multiple channels, you'll access them with an additional entry for the image

```
image[100:150, 1:50, 2]
                     ^
                     this refers to channel 2!
```

# Image Processing Workflow

---
<img src="image/week1/analysis-flowchart.png" width = 900>

,footnote[https://petebankhead.gitbooks.io/imagej-intro/content/chapters/colors/colors.html]

???

The first five weeks of class we'll focus on *image processing* - getting our images to the point that we can quantify them. 

The last five weeks of class we'll talk about spatial statistics and experimental design.
