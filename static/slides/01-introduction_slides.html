# Class Facilitator/TA

- Meet Sam Papadakis from the Fair Lab
- She will be helping me faciliate online sessions

---
# Introduction Overview

- Introduction to Zoom
- Learning Objectives
- Class Logistics

---
# First of All

- This is a brand new course
- Let's support each other
    - Be gentle with each other
- I expect to make many mistakes
    - I don't mind you pointing them out, but be gentle
    - You can end up as a collaborator!

---
# Tour of Zoom

- We'll be using zoom for our classes
- Let's do a quick guided tour

---
# Letting me Know

When we're doing the activity, use the hands up in Zoom to indicate that you're finished.

If you have questions, please ask them in chat.

---
# Let's Try Out Chat

Open the chat window (if we are in full screen, press the escape key, and then click on the chat icon)

&lt;img src="image/week1/zoom_chat.jpg" width = 800&gt;

Type in Chat:

- Your Name
- Your Year
- What you hope to learn from this course

---
# Rules for Interaction

During Lectures:

- Post questions in Chat
    - Sam will interrupt me to make sure these questions are answered
- Post answers to questions in chat
- We'll learn Hack.md for taking collaborative notes next lecture

---
# Rules for Interaction

During Labs:

- Work within your breakout group to solve 
- Share screens to talk about issues
- We'll pop in to each discussion group to help you out

---
# Sharing Your Screen

&lt;img src = "image/week1/screen sharing.jpg" width = 800&gt;

---
# Breakout Rooms

- I'll divide the class into breakout rooms for discussion and labs
- I'll ask each room for a summary

---
# Let's try the Breakout Rooms

- Let's try it (3 minutes)
- Icebreaker: What is your favorite all purpose condiment (such as salsa, ketchup, or chile oil?) and why?

---
# Zoom Recordings/Attendance

- I will record each session and post it as soon it is ready
- I will pause recording for breakout rooms (that won't be recorded)

# Class Logistics

---
# The Course This Year

- We will be covering some basic statistics in this course
- I advise you to also take CONJ 620
- I will try to limit the math, but there will be a little bit

---
# Learning Objectives

By the end of this course you will be able to:

- **Learn** and **execute** the basic steps of image analysis in R
- **Assess** whether image processing algorithms are working correctly
- **Understand** basic statistics and what it can help us with
- **Execute** and **Interpret** basic spatial statistics on data that are involved with fluoresence microscopy analysis

---
# My Approach to Teaching

I think students learn the best when they're actually looking and thinking about data.

This means we will be looking at lots of data.

---
# Social Learning and Labs

I also think that we learn best when we are discussing data together.

---

# This is a Safe Space to Ask Questions

---
# Code of Conduct

This class is governed by the [BioData Club Code of Conduct](https://biodata-club.github.io/code_of_conduct/).

This class is meant to be a psychologically safe space where it's ok to ask questions.

I want to normalize your own curiosity and fuel your desire to learn more.

If you are disruptive to class learning or disparaging to other students, I may mute you for the day.

---
# Class Slack

I have created a class Slack here: http://neus643.slack.com - the invite link should have been sent out.

I will try to answer questions there when I can. We'll take a tour of class next week.

If you have a question, please ask it in a public channel, rather than a private message, so it can benefit everyone.

- [Slack 101 Videos](https://slack.com/resources/slack-101)

---
# Class Attendance Policy

Please try to attend class. 

There is a post-class survey that will be posted. Please fill it out, as it counts as attendance.

---
# Office Hours

I will be available for office hours/drop in time 2 Hours a week (Sam will be available once a week). You're free to sign in to the Zoom Room and work on homework at this time.

When is good link: http://whenisgood.net/rretq92

Highlight all times that work for you.

---
# One Note about Scheduling

I only work 4 days a week. I'm not available on Wednesdays.

---
# Class Assignments

Class Assignments will be done in RStudio Notebooks (more during lab)

Assignments will be submitted through Sakai. 

We will do our best to return it to you by the following Monday.

---
# Why R?

R is an extremely powerful language for **statistical modeling**, machine learning, data manipulation, and visualization.

It's a *hub* language in that you can access many different kinds of systems (TensorFlow, Databases, Apache Spark) without needing to know other languages.

---
# This is Not a Programming Course

Most of the assignments will have you assessing the *impact* of a method on image data. 

We'll use some simple tools to do this.

The writing is the most important part of these assignments, not the coding. 

I want to see you thinking and observing about the data.

---
# R is Not Easy

- Learning R can be a difficult, but rewarding process
- Be patient with yourself, don't beat yourself up
- We'll try to make it a fun process for you

---
# R-Bootcamp

I am also teaching a 1 credit course this term called the R-Bootcamp that starts the week of April 6.

The focus is more on visualization, data wrangling, and simple statistics.

There should be an announcement sent out this week.

---
