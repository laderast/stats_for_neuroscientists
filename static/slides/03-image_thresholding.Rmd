# Image Thresholding and Binarization

---
# Learning Objectives

- **Learn** about *manual* and *adaptive* thresholding on an image to *binarize* it
- **Learn** about *Otsu's method* to select a threshold on an image
- **Learn** about *erosion* and *dilation* to fix artefacts in a binarized image

---
# Glossary

- **Region of Interest** - Part of an image where you want the analysis to concentrate on
- **Binarized image** - an image whose intensities have been reduced to two values: 0 and 1.
- **Threshold** - a cutoff that determines which intensity values become zero and which become 1. Those values that are above the cutoff become 0, and those above become 1
- **Otsu's Method** - A automated method for deciding a threshold
---
# Glossary Part 2

- **adaptive thresholding** - applying a different threshold value to different regions of the image based on local values
- **erosion** - applying a minimum value filter to an image - results in reducing the border around an image
- **dilation** - applying a maximum value filter to an image

**Segmenting** structures in image (also known as *object detection*) requires binarized images.

When we binarize, we take out all of the shades of grey in our image and make it black and white.

---
<img src = "image/week3/thresholding.JPG" width = 800>

???

So how do we decide the threshold for determining what is black and what is white?

---
<img src = "image/week3/manual.JPG" width = 800>

???

One way to do it is to do it manually - careful inspection of the image's histogram.

---
# Manual Example

.pull-left[<img src = "image/week3/manual_example.png" width = 400>]

.pull-right[<img src = "image/week3/manual_example2.png" width = 400>]

???

# Otsu's Threshold

Otsu's method is a way of deciding a threshold based on maximizing the variability between the 0-valued pixels and the 1 valued-pixels.

In this gif, we can see the variability plotted as a curve. Once we have this curve, we can find its maximum using calculus, and the maximum is our threshold.

# Otsu's Threshold

.pull-left[<img src = "image/week3/otsu-histogram.png" width = 400>]

.pull-right[<img src = "image/week3/otsu_image.png" width = 400>]

<img src="image/week3/adaptive_1.JPG" width = 800>

???

Much like filtering, we can use *neighborhoods* around a pixel to decide a threshold. This can help in situations where the illumination is uneven. This method is called *adaptive thresholding*.

We need to decide the size of our neighborhood. Then we build a "local" histogram from that and apply a thresholding algorithm to that local histogram. 

---

<img src="image/week3/adaptive_2.JPG" width = 800>

Here's another neighborhood and the mini histogram

In R, that neighborhood can be varied by both height and width.

# Now what?

- Examine binarized images for artefacts introduced in preprocessing
- Attempt to fix these artefacts
- Dilation and Erosion (manual)

---
<img src="image/week3/dilation.JPG" width = 800>

???

- One thing we can do to fix our images is an operation called *dilation*.
- *dilation* is a maximum filter on a neighborhood. 
- When the filter is on the edge of an object that is black and white, it will expand the object at its edges
- *dilation* can be really good at fixing "holes" in our objects

---
# Dilation

.pull-left[Otsu Threshold Image<img src = "image/week3/otsu_image.png" width = 400>
]
.pull-right[Dilated image<img src = "image/week3/dilated_image.png" width = 400> ]


---
<img src="image/week3/erosion.JPG" width = 800>

???

- The reverse operation is called *erosion*, where the object is a minimum filter
- The result is that the object becomes smaller at the edges

---
# Erosion

.pull-left[Otsu Threshold Image<img src = "image/week3/otsu_image.png" width = 400>
]
.pull-right[Eroded image<img src = "image/week3/eroded_image.png" width = 400> ]

---
# Opening

- *erosion* followed by *dilation*

.pull-left[Otsu Threshold Image<img src = "image/week3/otsu_image.png" width = 400>
]
.pull-right[Opened image<img src = "image/week3/opened_image.png" width = 400> ]

---
# Closing

- *dilation* followed by *erosion*

.pull-left[<img src = "image/week3/otsu_image.png" width = 400>
Otsu Threshold Image]
.pull-right[<img src = "image/week3/closed_image.png" width = 400> Opened image]


---
# Discussion

In breakout rooms, compare the opened and closed images.

Which operation is more appropriate?

Did the operations fix issues or create them?

---
# Your neighborhood's shape matters
