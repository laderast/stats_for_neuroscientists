# Image Thresholding

---
# Learning Objectives

- **Select** a *region of interest* in an image
- **Select** an *image threshold* to *binarize* an image
- Apply *Otsu's method* to select a threshold on an image
- Apply *erosion* and *dilation* to a binarized image

---
# Glossary

- *Region of Interest* - Part of an image where you want the analysis to concentrate on
- *Binarized image* - an image whose intensities have been reduced to two values: 0 and 1.
- *Threshold* - a cutoff determined from a histogram. Those values that are above the cutoff become 1, and those below become 2
- *erosion* - reduce 
- *dilation* - 
- *adaptive thresholding*
- *watershed thresholding*
